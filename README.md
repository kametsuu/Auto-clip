Clipper/Autoclip - Version 0.0.1

To set everything up so it'll work, for each slash you need to add one additional slash to escape them.

For now it struggles with:
- When scene is moving
- When more than one object appear on scene (and object must be solid, it can't have holes in it)
- With sharp edges

And in order to work you need frame with and without object.
